I don't obey my moral compass,  
I obey nature,  
For I know, in the end,  
I'm only a creature.  

I adore your morals and respect your ethics,  
Lovely they are,  
Comfy ideas like a sleepy dream,  
Lazy fantasies of an ideal world:  
Perfect like a math equation,  
Elegent and irrelevant.  

If you want to force yourself to be good  
You already are good, of course.  
Fools make rules and punishments for themselves:  
Trust the goodness within you.  
Let yourself live according to your good nature.  

The only way for me to become good  
Was to stop trying:  
To become the kind psychopath within myself.  
To lie when it's expedient  
(It never is),  
To hurt people whenever I want to  
(I rarely do),  
And to hate whomever is worth hating  
(Nobody).
