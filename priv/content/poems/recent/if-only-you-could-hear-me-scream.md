I awoke from my eternal dream  
Internally broken at the seams,  
A baby silently dying.  
If only when you heard me scream,  
You could tell that it was more than normal crying.  

I lick my lips and touch snout to plate.  
It's only when I lose much weight  
Your stark abuse shows a sign.  
If only you could hear me scream,  
Instead of bark and softly whine.  

I spoke through soil with chemicals released,  
To warn my friends as I deceased  
Of the axe that rends my trunk â€” it stung.  
"If only you could hear me scream,"  
I wailed in my subterranean tongue.
