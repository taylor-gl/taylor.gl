Grinding.  
Bones against bones  
Across worn joints,  
And achey moans  
In tired tones.  

Racing.  
Earning points,  
Smashing records,  
Dashing sore to the finish line —  
Slowly crashing.  

Winning.  
Winning at things I don't care about  
Just to feel you lose  
And me win,  
And to see it on the news.  

Spinning —  
Spin spin spin.  
Dizzy from chasing my tail.  
Sick and run frail  
But still busy:  
Can't stop — have to play the game —  
Until you tell me I'm special and say my name.
