Escapril prompt: describe a smell

Twist the thumbscrews and slide the case:  
Vivisect your silicon servant.  
Clumps of dust confirm respiratory issues.  
Shake and spray the cold can:  
Sshhhhht!  
Try not to sneeze as you smell  
The petrichor of dusty rain.  
Try not to sneeze...  
Finish cleaning,  
Start reassembling,  
This goes here,  
That goes there,  
Altogether now:  
Blinking,  
Buzzing,  
Whirring,  
Stirring,  
Smoking --  
Smoking?  
Sparking!  
Fzzzzt!  
Cold, dark.  
The patient is gone.  
Time of death: 3:14.  
Unplug and autopsy:  
Cause of death --  
A ruptured circulatory system  
Leading to neurological issues.  
Who decided to give a computer blood?
