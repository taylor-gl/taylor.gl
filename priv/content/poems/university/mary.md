Escapril prompt: make it rhyme

I came clad in multicolored polyester,  
Three bells on my hat like a jolly jester.  
Dressed to impress her, I took her on the rollercoaster.  
On the drop, in distress, she grabbed my hand and pulled me closer.  
We made out naked on the ferris wheel wary: no sound.  
Got spotted: now the boys all call her Mary-Go-Round.
