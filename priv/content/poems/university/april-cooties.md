Escapril prompt: april showers

April showers are best viewed through a pane  
of glass to save you from the rain;  
Double-glazed and polarized  
and block that blue light from our eyes.  
And if April showers don’t drain away,  
They’ll lead to flowers once it’s May;  
But when we stop to smell the roses  
We’ll always wear plugs in our noses  
To make quite sure that we do not sneeze  
Or interfere with the precious bees  
Who work when it’s hot as hell for honey,  
Which we bottle up and sell for money,  
Next to Nature’s Valley and Mountain Dew  
And houses with a mountain view.  
But we dare not climb the peak,  
We just want to take a peek,  
‘Cause when April showers she’s a naked beauty,  
I just hope I don’t get cooties.
