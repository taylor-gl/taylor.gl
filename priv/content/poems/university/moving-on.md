Escapril prompt: catharsis

I first saw her smile  
Under a whispered sunset;  
It was a wry smile —  
A happily-hang-you-out-to-dry smile —  
Complicated and captivating.  

Like a drunk to drink,  
And drunk I was, it's true,  
I approached her in a trance  
And as we met shoe-to-shoe,  
The liquid bounded and turned me over.  
Red wine!  
Red wine!  
We call vomit over!  

My internal dialogue and my real voice  
Blathered a babble of blundered apology,  
And she smiled a vicious smile —  
A killer smile — and laughed.  
She heard what I tried to say,  
Not what I said;  
It's what I liked about her.  

Bonded over vomit,  
We soon fell in love laughing,  
But contentment is a slippery hill.  
I don't know if she stopped listening,  
Or I stopped talking,  
But we fell into the trap of feeling trapped.  

My closest friends never liked her,  
She was a flower,  
Now wilting,  
Whose petals only I could see,  
And at last our relationship —  
A bubble held together by tension —  
Popped.  

Today is no special date.  
Today is only the day I realized:  
I finally forget her face.  
Everything except that smile.  
That lovingly-leave-you-twisting-in-the-wind smile.  
I would sooner forget my own name.
