Escapril prompt: incorporate music

I can hear you.  
I hear you singing through broken walls,  
Notes like open  
doors.  

I can hear you.  
I hear the sound of your empty voice  
Ringing in my memory  
As if you were  
here.  

I see your walk.  
High heels stepping so unkind  
Poking holes in my fragile mind:  
Wounds I feel when I’m  
alone.  

I see your body  
Like music dancing on empty walls,  
I feel your touch  
Like a passerby tapping my shoulder  
To ask for directions,  
But when I turn to look there’s  
nobody there.  

And I’m the one who’s lost.  
My skin calls for yours.  
The world is ugly in your shadow,  
Your voice a tinnitus to my silence.  
So many of my senses taken by you;  
How will I take them back  
If you won’t take me back?  

Lunar desire of silence  
Sprout hair from fragile flesh;  
Rage me ragged,  
Breaking dishes,  
Mixing tears with shampoo,  
Staring at dishes with blurred focus,  
Pulling sheets taut with long sighs,  
Hands pulling hair,  
Forehead to knee,  
How could you forget me?  
To ever again hear a song like you,  
Must I pick up an instrument and learn to play?
