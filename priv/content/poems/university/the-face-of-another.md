Escapril prompt: a love poem

Stamping feet kicked dirt;  
Faces painted,  
The glow of fire  
Danced us around.  

Silhouettes of clapping hands,  
Our shadows dark –  
And still yours stuck  
In my eyes across the fire.  

I once clung to you  
Like a tick to a donkey’s ass,  
Pathetic and worse to know  
I love you still,  
After the circle has shifted  
And we no longer  
Dance together.  

We’re more often burned  
with love than with fire,  
But I’ll find you  
Again  
In the face of another  
When the dance changes  
Again
