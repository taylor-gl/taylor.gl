Escapril prompt: not from your perspective

I stare at the sky through dirty glass with brutal equanimity  
As I lie limp in the grass hairy-naked missing my family.  
I don’t feel hatred or self-pity like the rest of the chimps.  
For I have created in captivity meaning, a destiny glimpse  
In the clouds through unwashed windows.  

There’s sense to lodge complaint.  
Medical testing,  
Cosmetic research,  
Chemical restraint,  
Keeping us in metal cages,  
Ignore our crying and banging rages;  
Think us more as beasts when we rebel.  
It’s true, of my kind I have it well.  
You pay for tickets, to my zoo you go,  
To stare and point at us,  
A stationary minstrel show  
Where we’re thought of as  
Happy-go-lucky loungeabouts,  
Because we lack your shame and neuroticism,  
Your language and your puritanism.  

But I don’t rebuke for what you do,  
For our speech of the body is strange to you,  
And when I make your girls giggle through the glass,  
When you show me phone pictures while I sit in the grass  
I see that you have good hearts.  
You broke my family apart,  
But I know we can still when we are captured  
Stare at the clouds and be enraptured.
