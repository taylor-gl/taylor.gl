Escapril prompt: focus on the colour

Prismatic you,  
Red, yellow, green, blue,  
Iridescent shadows join on emphatic cue  
Your chromatic form to one dramatic hue:  
Bizarre, unfamiliar, exotic.  
Hypnotic opalescent narcotic  
Now a stranger to my sight:  
No longer complicated, chaotic,  
You are my sunshine:  
Boring, reliable, beautiful â€“  
Bountiful white light.
