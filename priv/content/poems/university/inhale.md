We kept swimming.  
We kept the water moving over our gills.  
We listened, ignorant,  
Our heartbeat was the answer.  
But we listened, ears to ground,  
For hoofbeats we'd never hear.  

We looked at the world closely  
through microscopes and telescopes,  
but the message, blurred out of focus,  
was written on the lens:  
  "Dance, and be friends.  
   Sing and think less.  
   When you're drowning in fear,  
   Inhale.  
   Love while the love is in you."
