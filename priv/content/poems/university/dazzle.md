Escapril prompt: pick an animal

Alone the zebra's stripes say, "eat me!"  
And call to the cheetah's bite (or tsetse),  
But grouping up will hide their limbs,  
And form a whirlwind when stride begins  
To dazzle any watchful eyes;  
Careful: blood will botch the disguise.  
On the savannah to stand out is to die.  
So when I see the giraffe, I just think, "why?"
