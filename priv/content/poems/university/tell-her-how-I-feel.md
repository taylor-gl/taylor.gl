Escapril prompt: may flowers

I could give her a box of chocolates,  
That's the usual practice,  
I could give her a box of chocolates,  
But I fear anaphylaxis.  

I could take her out to dinner,  
And tell her how I feel.  
I could take her out to dinner,  
But I could aspirate my meal.  

I could give her May flowers,  
But then what would she think of me?  
I could give her May flowers,  
But I might have a nervous syncope.  

Upon consideration,  
This pressure is giving me the bends.  
Upon consideration,  
Maybe it's best to stay friends.
