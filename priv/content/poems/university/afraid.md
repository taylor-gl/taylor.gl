Escapril prompt: start with a time of day

Midnight: Fear jerks my stomach when I remember: one day Iâ€™ll be  
unborn.  
1 AM: Air leaves my room and I know if elephants die, I must  
too.  
2 AM: Hands tremble and stars of silent night offer no comfort.  
3 AM: Gasping for breath, sheets and eyes turn wet as I drown in precognition.  
4 AM: Let go at last; exhale and fall mortal into sheets of cold  
unconscious  
.  
.  
.  
8 AM: Wake up. Smile.
