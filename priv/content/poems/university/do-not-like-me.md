I don’t have that much fucking time  
To have a time that’s fucking good,  
But the time doesn’t run out like it should,  
It grins and laughs,  
Then disappears.  
Now you have it,  
Now you don’t.  

Even if I had forever  
And could wander in reverie,  
I’d be replaced memory by memory,  
Like the Ship of Theseus,  
By a doppelganger:  
Wiser than me,  
Kinder than me.  

So, if you want to be my lovely,  
Know you really shouldn’t love me.  
As you shouldn’t eat the dough  
Of unbaked cookies,  
You shouldn’t dare fall in love  
With virgin rookies,  
Like me.  

Know you really shouldn’t love me,  
For I have the lifespan of a flea,  
And even if I make it  
to the age of 84,  
I’ll not yet be my best self  
For 100 years more,  
So don’t waste your two blinks  
On one you should abhor  
Like me.
