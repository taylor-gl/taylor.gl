Escapril prompt: liar, liar

I live in a frigid house of ice.  
The walls lie and say they're rigid,  
Not melting at all,  
But when I look at the wall,  
It's drip, drip, dripping.  

I take a look at stars hiding behind clouds.  
They lie and say they're not aligned.  
They say they're far away,  
But they move with me when I sway,  
And this ice has me slip, slip, slipping.  

My thoughts have been hectic and I now see  
That my skin lies and says it's not electric.  
Words dance but my eyes swear they're not dyslexic.  
And I've always been a skeptic,  
But the ice breaks and  
The waves below feel magnetic  
When I'm trip, trip, tripping.
