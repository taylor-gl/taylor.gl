Escapril prompt: any dreams?

    taylor@linuxbox:~$ ruby meaning-of-life.rb  
    Every 24 hours we drop  
    (Though some are shaky on the steps).  
    We slow dance to the circadian symphony:  
    Walk,  
    Drop,  
    Dream,  
    Stop,  
    Repeat.  
    A dancing plague —  
    Stop dancing and you die.  
    Even the ants sleep each day for 16 minutes,  
    Why?  
    What do they dream?  
    If there is a god, does he sleep too?  
    Are we his dream?  
    If you lived forever in a dream,  
    Would you know it?  
    Would you learn to hear the hoofbeats  
    Of a nightmare dashing across your mind?  
    If you finally awoke from a world of  
    Teeth falling out,  
    Tripping and falling,  
    Being chased,  
    And being naked at school,  
    Would you relax and stop asking,  
    "Why? Why? Why?"
