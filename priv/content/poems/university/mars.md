Escapril prompt: celestial bodies

When the blue had left the sky,  
A prick of light had caught their eye.  
They saw with scopes, their vision aided,  
The red flesh of a figure hanging naked.  
They all sighed and thought to conquer, yes â€“  
They would die or capture Mars undressed.  

They drew the plans, sent out the troops,  
Snapped their buttons, strapped their boots,  
Fired bullets at the dark above that cursed them,  
Sending rockets at the sky that nursed them.  

At last they rode their final ark,  
Clattering through space,  
Firmly fighting the dark,  
Battering to grace.  
They battled the blackness,  
Advanced,  
Manned their stations,  
They entered her orbit  
And danced with her through creation.
