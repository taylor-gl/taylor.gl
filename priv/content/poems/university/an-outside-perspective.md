Escapril prompt: femininity

The boys, a happy and fatuous lot,  
Ran and stomped through life smiling,  
Thinking they had everything  
Until the day their eyes changed  
And they could finally see the girls.  
Turns out they had nothing.  

The boys, now men, feeling their lack,  
Went out and built devices, factories, cities,  
(No girls allowed!)  
All dedicated to replicating and bottling  
The feminine –  
The beauty they saw when their eyes changed.  

They worked themselves stupider,  
Pouring daylight and moonlight  
And birthdays into the pointless project,  
When the women, growing slightly nervous  
They might actually succeed, shouted out,  
“We’re right here, you idiots!”
