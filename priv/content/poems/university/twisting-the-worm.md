Escapril prompt: anxiety

I took the foul liquid in my lips;  
It seemed so limpid at the time of tasting.  
The insipid water taken to my hips  
And soon my flesh a victim to a wasting.  
Quick heart strokes and retching stuck fast —  
A worm’s head broke a putrid pustule on my waist.  
To rid my body of the worm at last  
I wrapped it ‘round a stick and turned with wary pace.  
Each leery quarter twist was marked by calendar, not clock;  
Of the affair to others I was reticent.  
A hair too far: the worm would break and I would die of shock;  
For months resolve and hope my only medicines.  
At last I plucked it out and I could, smiling, see:  
The parasite was not so scary once I pulled it free.
