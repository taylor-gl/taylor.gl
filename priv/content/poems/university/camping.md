Escapril prompt: when the party's over

Birds chirp my sleeping ears awake  
As I step toward the fire pit.  
Early morning air cool in the lungs  
Smells of smoke  
As I look at the ring of chairs,  
Now empty,  
And empty cans around the fire pit.  
I take one still-mostly-full can  
And pour it onto the ashes,  
Now cold,  
Just to see them billow.  
I notice my chair across the fire pit,  
Empty like my day.  
Time to fill it.
