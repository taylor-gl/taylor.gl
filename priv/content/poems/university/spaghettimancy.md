Escapril prompt: a fresh start

You waited ‘till the pot was ready,  
Then you cast in the spaghetti;  
The sticks of pasta pierced the roiling boil  
As your hands reached fierce for the spoiling oil.  
Splish!  
Splash!  
A dash of olive oil from the bottle’s neck;  
A second, a third – what the heck!  
You strained the spaghetti and plated it well,  
And you drained the sauce jar – what the hell?  
The oil added with such jubilance  
Simply acted as a lubricant  
You, feeling a fool, started to become irate  
As sauce pooled at the bottom of your plate.  
Ksshhhhh!  
Fill the pot again as you imagine a fresh start;  
Try again at this Italian dark and arcane art.
