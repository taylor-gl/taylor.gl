Fist slamming on walls,  
The shrieking maiden calls.  
He wades through the bloody hallway  
To where Inioj the priestess bawls.  

Images tear across his sight.  
Through the window pours the night.  
He seeks the priestess' aid in redemption  
To sooth his seething plight.  

Open the heavy, iron door,  
And life flows onto the floor.  
He closes his eyes,  
To dream away the gore.  

Walking toward her but ever retreating.  
Inioj the priestess sat, slowly repeating  
Hymns, prayers, pleas, and screams,  
To aid his unrelenting bleeding.  

His blood poured from him in a torrential rain.  
He blistered and boiled in immense pain.  
And the divine aid of Inioj  
Was entirely in vain.  

The man, eyes closed, sat down on his knees,  
Paying little attention to Inioj's pleas.  
Sitting next to the black window,  
He relaxed in the breeze.
