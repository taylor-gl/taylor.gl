Sunbeams through panes of glass onto messy hair,  
Warming her head,  
Drinking lemonades and teas without a care,  
Relaxing in bed,  
Coral reefs and sand  
At the foot of the nightstand,  
Water washing autumn ashore,  
Reflecting oranges and reds onto patterned walls  
And through the French door,  
The crab and the music box having a ball,  
On a tired, weary, lazy, timeless, ever-lasting evening,  
With the sun a semi-circle stopped half-cropped against the horizon  
Hiding, under a lace pastel lampshade,  
From closed-mouth giggles  
While the minnow by the laundry hamper wriggles,  
Looking for clothes and depressed,  
Unable to find a mate  
Because it’s underdressed.
