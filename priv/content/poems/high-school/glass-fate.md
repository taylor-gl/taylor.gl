Glass fate:  
Past eight.  
Gaze fixed to a pistol's end.  
Crystal facets mixed to send  
Bright light or the plight of night,  
Asphalt underfoot,  
Soot-stalled sight.  
The fault of smooth facets appaled.  
Cage locked from inside â€” can't be mauled.  
The phage, outside, lies heart blocked and gun cocked,  
And on the polished crystal surfaces glass,  
On a date of pistols clashed,  
The wind ravaged and rocked.  

Glass fate:  
Too late.  
Smoking tip upon  
And choking my weapon.  
The asphalt caked with crystal salt:  
The glass fault,  
Air-chipped and cracked,  
On asphalt paved black,  
Glinting light saved naught.  
Diamond wind was wrought,  
And where we fought,  
The red blood of the dead was sought.
