Past Thursday: autumn wind blew in from the west â€”  
A leaf ballet with twinned moist and fresh scents expressed,  
Blowing from the forest, leaving vast, grand trees undressed,  
Showing a glorious golden pinnacle on sandy leaves abreast.  
Your leaves are now a quarter, Mother Nature, do you suggest?  
Your skirt is getting shorter and I'm afraid I must protest.  
You see, madam, this year I've got a spine,  
And I can clearly hear the bees on the decline,  
And when I polled the dandelions, they numbered only nine.  
While leaves of gold seem lively fun, their encumbrance is malign:  
They bring the cold and frost and snow that make my cheer decline,  
So if you'd uphold the summer, please, you'd simply be divine.
