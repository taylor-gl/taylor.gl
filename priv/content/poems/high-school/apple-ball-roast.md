As I adjusted my suit at the ball,  
Upon me did a young but worn angel fall  
For the first time.  

With short and wavy hair the waitress,  
Somewhat tall,  
Came from the back room to offer me  
Some apple balls,  
Which I accepted.  

She smiled, young but with a crease by each eye,  
And offered to water them, put them on rice, and then fry  
The balls if I came to the back room.  

In the stuffy back room of the ballroom kitchen I waited,  
Then I, by the waitress, was brought riced apple balls plated  
Along with two glasses of wine.  

I drank my glass and we laughed for a bit,  
Until, on the door, we heard three swift hits,  
And in came a male cook.  

We hid the wine before he could ask,  
So instead he asked of some menial task,  
And began to leave.  

To look proper, I thought I'd leave too,  
But I said by mistake to the waitress, "I love you",  
And embarrassed her in front of the cook until I added  
"In a platonic way."  

It was then that I shook off my dream,  
And I awoke where I lay,  
In the sunbeam through the window  
Of midday.  

Late for the market I raced out of my room  
And out to my car  
And then soon I was at the market  
After travelling not far.  

Sad for the dream, I wandered around  
And wondered what life would be like if I had stayed,  
If I could,  
If I had not heard the sound  
Of three knocks on that dusty door of wood.  

And then I saw a phantom, a ghost,  
Who looked like the wavy-haired waitress from the dream.  
I asked, as a joke to myself,  
"Have you ever made an apple ball roast  
For a man at a ball in a dream?"  

The meal made no sense  
And I turned to leave,  
But the look on her face hence:  
She, for a moment, seemed to believe.

She then smiled and laughed  
"You can't be the guy,  
I'm just being daft."  
And as she laughed I saw a crease by each eye.  

She did not turn to leave as her speech suggested,  
But instead her feet and her gaze were firmly arrested,  
And her self-deprecating smile turned to wonder.  
"Perhaps you'd like to leave here and join me  
For an apple-ball meal."  
And I took her arm the way she had done  
The night before and could feel  
Her lean in to my arm and smile the smile  
Of an old sould and then say,  
"Or perhaps a meal that exists."  
And we left her friend at the market  
And walked away.
