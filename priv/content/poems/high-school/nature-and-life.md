Water trickling downhill like blood from veins.  
Moon changing on the windowsill and complexion fades.  
Sun brilliant and drooping; lost will of sleepy eyes.  
Wind resiliant, brushing desert sand with deep breaths from tired lungs.  
Burdened trees' strained stance against gravity; limbs and joints aching.  
A field cannot frown but its strain is evident by the sad grasses leaning away.  
There's no difference but darkness and rain in weather and day,  
And from the viewpoint of birds, all feathers are gray.
