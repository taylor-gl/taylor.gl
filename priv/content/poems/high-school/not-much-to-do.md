I awoke without a start  
In my otherwise empty flat.  
I made myself some tea,  
And I put on my hat.  

Exiting the building,  
I locked the door.  
I rubbed my back  
Because it was sore.  

I went to work at the mechanic's shop,  
Fixing the lock on their gate,  
Then I went to a movie  
After it got late.  

It was a good movie  
And I enjoyed watching it,  
Even though there was a tall man  
In front of where I had to sit.  

Then I got tired,  
So I retired to bed,  
And before I fell asleep  
I scratched my head.
