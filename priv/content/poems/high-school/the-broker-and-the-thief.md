The thief makes off with numerous goods,  
Then takes off into the mysterious woods,  
Shrouded by the shadows of the midnight street,  
Hidden in hoods,  
Dropping his flickering oil lantern  
At his feet,  
He makes his snickering caped escape as branches burn.  

The wealthy broker awakens to the snapping of the flaming trees,  
His tax-free taken fortune taken from him free from fees.  
That malicious crook has made his riches be relinquished.  
To find the fiend, the broker douses the land with drowning seas,  
A torrent of water to make the criminal pay his debt,  
The rapacious and renewing fires of the thief extinguished,  
The choking shrubs and grasses charred and soaking wet,  
And a hapless housebreaker floating helpless downstream.
