The father is the center of the family;  
The lion of the familial jungle.  

He, wearing suits he has seen before,  
Rules like an emperor panguin,  
Stout and chest puffed.  

He, the patriarch, bears the  
Burdens of the family,  
Like a generous tree in a familial forest,  
Or a patriotic eagle,  
Governing from atop his leather throne.  

The mother boasts of the father to her friends.  
Yes! He, a powerful pendant prize,  
A swelling trophy,  
Fulfills the wills of his family;  
Their desires his generous tasks.  

Each day, the mighty patriarch's  
Body grows,  
With the wisdom of mighty adipose,  
And with it his heart expands,  
Giving in to familial demands.  

And in the best of homes,  
Where the father reigns highest,  
The pavlovian patriarch  
Uses his own father-sized door,  
Feeds on his own father-formulated food,  
And wears his name proudly around his neck  
For all to see.
