One second  
And another  
And a third:  
Three counts mentally numb,  
A tired tongue amounting to being dumb.  
Thoughts, impossible to grasp, slip away.  
Mental relaxation is mental decay,  
So sleep hard,  
Like a whore a hundred times sexed,  
Or a drug-addicted vagrant vexxed  
With a thousand needle pricks  
Now immune to the kicks of the high.  
But inject to live low:  
Stave off the moment where you die.  

Eyes taking three seconds just to focus.  
A magician living life in a passive dream.  
So "hocus pocus", as it seems  
Limbs are heavy and eyes are stinging  
As the lifeless magician wades through the day,  
Swimming.  

A passive vessel,  
Three seconds gone in a blink,  
Succumbing to animalistic tendencies,  
Submitting to instinct:  
A zombie â€”  
Not of death  
But with the taste of sleep on breath,  
And with the weak and quivering muscles  
Of a fatigued phantom or ghast  
Living three seconds in the past.
