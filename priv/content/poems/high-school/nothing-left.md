One tired evening,  
Clouds burned red by the sun,  
Each exhausted soldier  
Forgot how to fire their gun.  
Every man in scorched fields  
Could not use a knife,  
Or bomb from a plane:  
Could not take a life.  
This day was sacred,  
Like never before.  
They all cleared their eyes  
To wipe away gore.  
Then they saw people,  
Guns in their hands  
So out of place,  
All gathered in bands.  
One man sang out,  
Nobody knows who,  
But they all joined the song,  
What else could they do?
