You've wet yourself — it's your big day!  
Your fair-skinned, freckled little baby's on its way.  
Your handsome blonde husband takes you into the car,  
Tells you to be calm,  
And off you are.  
The hospital's such an excitement:  
You're sat down,  
And after a while your smile's a fat frown:  
Sweating  
Contracting  
Breathing  
Shaking  
Pushing  
Splitting  
Birthing — The baby is finally here.  
So excited for your new family life that you shed your frown,  
But your husband is shocked,  
And you too, when you look down:  
You never planned to be a single mother,  
But unfortunately, the babe's the wrong color!  
Your man looks to you, wide-eyed, waiting for explanation.  
"It's simple, my dear: it's genetic mutation."
