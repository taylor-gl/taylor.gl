The primordial ordinary ooze  
Spawns the part,  
With its own genetic alteration of information,  
Another iteration of the same.  
A single cell,  
A solitary green leaf,  
A part that feeds the whole.  

The whole births the part,  
And in turn the part sustains the whole.  

The parts: two dogs, rabid, spilling blood,  
Wrestling in the sweaty basement ring,  
Taught to kill by cheering competitors.  
The breeder smiles in the dark corner,  
Ignorant.  

Every nail sustains the stress of the ship;  
Every seam contains the tension of the tailored top.  

On the thousandth turning of the clock's small hand  
A single hair becomes aware of the existence of the head,  
A second is enlightened to the concept of a single day,  
And on counting, heads and years turn grey.  

Of the infinitely divisible motions of the greater act,  
The part of consideration is the ceasation of motion.  
The rest is a blur in the whole;  
The rest is another iteration of the same.  

On a solstice day  
The ordinary bee imagines the hive  
And through its profound conclusion,  
Guides the actions of the other bees,  
And thus the action of the hive,  
So that they may themselves consume more sugar,  
Weakening the honey,  
Greening the leaves and withering the trunk,  
Coloring the hairs to grey the head,  
Poisoning the whole.  

When the note guides the composition  
Every song will be a solid C,  
And the hive will find starvation  
When guided by the action of a single bee.  
When the mother, senile, is guided by her children,  
She will find herself abandoned in professional care,  
Her infants a blur in a generation,  
Another iteration of the same.
