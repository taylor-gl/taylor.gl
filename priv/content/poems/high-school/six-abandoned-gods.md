Six stone gods sat atop stone pillars,  
Guarding the near-black seabed,  
Guarding from the grey masked killers,  
By currents washed colourless and dead.  

Carved long ago by paranoid primatives  
Who abandoned at sight of a better opportunity.  
In the sky is not where gods live,  
But deep in the sea, standing with circular unity.  

Time slows the travel of light through a bottomless sea to a crawl,  
Rain continues, raising the water,  
And through the dim water six gods continue to fall,  
And light follows, illuminating the slaughter.  

The grey-skinned killers drift too, in no hurry,  
Surrounded by several generations of kin.  
Faces made calm by the cold water — no worry —  
On the floor of the bottomless sea made dim by their sins.
