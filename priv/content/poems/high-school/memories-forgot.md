We only ever are privileged with the experience of a single day,  
We simply live it many times, but here's the price we pay:  
To live the day again we pay a massive fare,  
Worse than a gut without food or lungs without air.  
The price we pay's the memory of every day before,  
But if we can't remember, then what's left to adore?  
Have you ever wondered why babies cry a lot?  
It's the inescapable burden of memories forgot,  
The aching desire to make the day last,  
The insatiable thirst to cling to the past.  
Even when living, the days blend together,  
So enjoy you this day, you've lived it forever.
