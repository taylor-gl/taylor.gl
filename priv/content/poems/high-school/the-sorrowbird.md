The lonely little sorrowbird  
Searched slowly through the trees  
Taking his time, he flew at a low speed,  
Searching for a mate to build  
A family.  

First he searched the clouds,  
But there he found no gain,  
And then he tried the treetops,  
But that, too, was in vain.  
He tried again the sky —  
No sorrowbird in sight  
Found nothing in the pebble pond —  
Not to his delight.  
He tried at last the berry patch,  
And there he found no luck.  
He could not find a sorrowbird,  
But just three eggs of duck.  

The lonely little sorrowbird  
Chirped sorrowfully, as sorrowbirds do.  
This sorrowbird was the last of them,  
But he had just thought of a way to build  
A family.  

He dug out from the berry patch  
Just one egg of duck,  
Started heading to the pebble pond,  
Noting changes in his luck.  
There he saw a crow egg,  
Much to his delight,  
He took it in his feathers,  
And stowed it out of sight.  
Where the treetops scratched the sky,  
His endeavor was in vain,  
But he searched a little lower,  
And a sparrow egg was his gain.  

The lonely little sorrowbird  
Was not lonely anymore.  
He let out a more cheerful chirp  
To signify the beginning of his  
New family.
