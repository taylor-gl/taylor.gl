By Taylor Lunt and Courtney Hermary, who each wrote every other line. Lines starting with a * were written by Taylor.

*Light beams glisten through the fog now,  
Of all the Sun's light the atmosphere will allow;  
*Thick and choking, the clouds constrict,  
Embracing the earth in bag-thick fabric.  
*How beautiful the Sun of the earlier day,  
Now darkened by fog to grim hues of gray.  

Nature sits engulfed by these mists,  
*Plagued by cancerous tumours and lettered with cysts.  
Tree-trunk bark rots; beauty forgot,  
*Birds falling from the skies, universe naught.  
Gazing at the sky, we pray to starlight.  
*Embers floating down bring the stars of night.
