# Taylor G. Lunt's Website
[My website/blog](https://taylor.gl) is a Phoenix application, which uses `postcss-loader` and `tailwindcss` for styling, as per [this guide](https://pragmaticstudio.com/tutorials/adding-tailwind-css-to-phoenix). It has an RSS feed and supports auto-discovery.

Since `tailwindcss` generates thousands of CSS classes, most of which are unused by this project, we automatically purge the unneeded classes when we are running in production (but not in development).

## Blog
Using `yamerl` and `earmark` to process my markdown blog posts. I learned how to do this from this [blog post](http://www.sebastianseilund.com/static-markdown-blog-posts-with-elixir-phoenix). In order to integrate `tailwindcss` with the HTML generated by `earmark`, I use an `earmark` postprocessor to insert classes like `markdown-h3`, which I then style in the CSS file (using `tailwindcss`).

## Resume
Also on my website is my [resume](https://taylor.gl/resume), which is the size of a letter piece of paper and can be easily printed or downloaded as a PDF file by clicking the `PDF download` button. The resume is an original design written in HTML/CSS using `tailwindcss`.

## Deployment
The posts/drafts themselves on my blog are not included in the public repo, as I don’t want my draft posts read by anyone, and I’d like it to be marginally more difficult to steal my posts. As such, they are included as a separate private submodule. I also include private deployment instructions in that private submodule.

When dealing with submodules, set `git config –global submodule.recurse true` to make sure pulling from the parent module also pulls from the submodule. Or clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:taylor-gl/taylor.gl.git`
