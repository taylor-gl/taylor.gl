# Taylor G. Lunt's Blog

[My website/blog](https://taylor.gl) is a Phoenix application, which uses `postcss-loader` and `tailwindcss` for styling, as per [this guide](https://pragmaticstudio.com/tutorials/adding-tailwind-css-to-phoenix).

Since `tailwindcss` generates thousands of CSS classes, most of which are unused by this project, we automatically purge the unneeded classes when we are running in production (but not in development).

Using `yamerl` and `earmark` to process my markdown blog posts. I learned how to do this from this [blog post](http://www.sebastianseilund.com/static-markdown-blog-posts-with-elixir-phoenix). In order to integrate `tailwindcss` with the HTML generated by `earmark`, I use an `earmark` postprocessor to insert classes like `markdown-h3`, which I then style in the CSS file (using tailwindcss).

Also on my website is my [resume](https://taylor.gl/resume), which is the size of a letter piece of paper and can be easily printed or downloaded as a PDF file.
